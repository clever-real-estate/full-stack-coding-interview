# Clever Full Code Interview

#### Why Django for Backend?
  - I went with Django for the backend because it's widely used at Clever, and I wanted to showcase my skills in a technology that's familiar to the team.
#### The Frontend Story
  - Originally, I planned to stick with React for the frontend. But after checking out the React Documentation, I found out that using React without a framework is deprecated. So, I decided to use Next.js exclusively for the frontend. However, this introduced some challenges.
  
  - While Next.js is awesome using both client-side and server-side rendering, I had to make it work only for client-side rendering. It wasn't a perfect fit, especially when it came to stuff like protecting routes and adding tokens to requests. But I made it work, in the simplest way that I found taking in consideration you guys asked to not waste so much time in this challenge.

  - Sure, using only Next.js would have made things simpler, but I really wanted to showcase my Python and Django skills.

  - In the end, I focused on getting the job done without overcomplicating things. There's definitely room for improvement, like better error handling and adding loading spinners for backend requests. But for now, it's good enough.

#### Future Plans:
- Backend:
    - Dockerize the Django project.
    - Set up different settings for production and development.
    - Create Admin interfaces for managing photos and users.
    - Customize the user model.
    - Add linting and unit tests.
- Frontend:
    - Improve error handling.
    - Create Error and Loading components.
    - Design custom components like links and buttons.
    - Consider caching photo requests if needed.
    - Integrate ESLint and write Cypress tests.
    - Boost SEO using Next.js features.
