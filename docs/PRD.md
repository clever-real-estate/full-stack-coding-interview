- **As a user**, I want to see photo details (photographer, dimensions, description) so that I can learn about each image
- **As a user**, I want pagination so that I can navigate through large collections efficiently
- **As a user**, I want responsive design so that I can browse on any device

#### Social Interaction
- **As a user**, I want to like photos so that I can show appreciation for content
- **As a user**, I want to see my previous likes so that I can track my preferences
